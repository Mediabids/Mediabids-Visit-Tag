This is the custom tag template for Mediabids landing page visits. 
This tag will read the Mediabids campaign id (mb_campaign) and URL source code (mb_source) 
from the redirected URL parameters, store them as first-party cookies, and then send a post-back to MBLink.it to log the visit.

This tag should be used in conjunction with the Mediabids Conversion Tag 
which reads the cookie information stored here to send a conversion post-back to the Mediabids tracking platform: MBLink.it.
